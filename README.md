Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy Using Machine Learning
 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, directly impacting revenue and growth. This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict customer churn by analyzing customer demographic, behavioral, and transactional data. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave and provide data-driven retention strategies to improve customer loyalty and lifetime value.

Objectives

Predict customer churn using machine learning classification models

Identify key factors influencing customer churn

Evaluate and compare multiple models for optimal performance

Provide actionable retention strategies based on analytical insights

Dataset

Contains customer demographics, usage patterns, and service-related attributes

Includes a binary churn indicator (Yes / No) as the target variable

Preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables

Technologies & Tools

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost / Gradient Boosting

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Insights & Retention Strategy

Identified high-risk customer segments

Proposed targeted retention strategies based on model insights

Key Insights

Customers with low engagement and high service issues are more likely to churn

Contract type and tenure significantly impact churn probability

Personalized offers and proactive customer support can reduce churn

Business Impact

Enables proactive identification of at-risk customers

Helps businesses reduce customer acquisition costs

Improves customer retention and long-term revenue

Future Enhancements
